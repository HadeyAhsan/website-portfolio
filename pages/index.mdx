# Hadi Ahsan

Hi! Welcome to my professional portfolio website! My name is Hadi, and I am a software engineer intern with a passion for building robust and scalable applications.

During my time as an intern, I have gained valuable experience in Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Django, Linux, Terraform (and more) which has allowed me to contribute to a variety of projects and work effectively with cross-functional teams. Whether it's developing new features, debugging code, or optimizing application performance, I enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems and finding innovative solutions.

On this website, you'll find examples of some of the projects I've worked on, as well as my technical skills, education, and professional experience. I hope that this portfolio will give you a sense of my approach to software development and the value that I can bring to your team.

If you're interested in learning more about my work or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
